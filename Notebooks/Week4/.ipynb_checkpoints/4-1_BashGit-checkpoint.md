# Git commands

### 1. git clone

If you have previously attended a D-Lab workshop you have probably downloaded some workshop materials from GitHub by clicking a download button, downloading the .ZIP file, and then extracting that .ZIP file to your Desktop. 

The Git equivalent is [**git clone**](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone), but the process is similar: 

1. Visit a GitHub repository, like for this [BashGit workshop](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/BashGit) or for upcoming [R-Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals) or [Python-Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals) workshops. 

2. Click the green "Clone or download" button

3. However, this time click the clipboard icon to copy the URL

4. At your Bash prompt type **git clone URL** to clone the repository (paste the URL)

For example: 

> `$`git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals.git

> `$`git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals.git

5. Type **git pull** to ensure you have the latest remote version of the repository

### 2. Before you create your own repository, familiarize yourself with the basic workflow jargons!

### Fork → Clone → Pull → Stage → Commit → Push → Pull request → Merge

**Fork:** A copy of a repository; you can experiment freely without affecting the original repository. You can fork a repository to make proposed changes. 

**Clone:** Download an existing Git repository to your local computer, while the original still lives on the remote server. 

**Pull:** synchronize your local repository with changes in the central upstream repo (even though it is cloned from the origin) ... (and pushed to the fork!)

> NOTE: The **Origin** is the URL of the upstream repopsitory, but the **Upstream** is the maintainer's repository; once cloned, the origin becomes wherever it was cloned from. 

**Stage:** Designate altered files to be included in the next commit.

**Commit:** Revisions to a file/set of files that creates a unique ID of those changes ("hash") to track changes that are pushed. 

**Push:** Send your committed local changes to a remote repository. 

**Pull request:** A way to communicate changes you wish to make to a repository, used to facilitate discussion with collaborators and additional commits before it is merged into the master branch. 

**Merge:** Turning a pull request's changes into a single commit and merged into the master branch. 

### 3. Simplifying this process in five steps:

1. First, **cd** into the local directory on your laptop where you wish to make changes before adding them to your remote GitHub repository. 

2. **git add .** changes you want to make from your laptop to the remote GitHub repository. This function will stage all local files to be committed to the remote repository (replace . with an individual filename if desired). 

3. **git commit -m "commit message"** commit your local changes to remote and add a message for documentation purposes. 

4. **git push -u origin master** push your local changes from your laptop to overwrite the remote GitHub repository. 

5. **refresh** your GitHub repository URL to see the changes! 

### 4. Other usefull functions

**git status** view files ready to be committed; run this after the "git add" function

**git log** view commits

**git log -p -2** view commit details (press Enter to see more lines; press q to quit)

**git checkout -b branch_name** will create a new branch.
