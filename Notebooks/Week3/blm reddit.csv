0,25,I live in L.A. and have been involved in a lot of progressive community activism in L.A. I know there are a ton of people sitting out over COVID fears and to still see this turnout is so fucking wonderful.
1,22,Then they'd all be busy with their wage slavery
2,1,"Or afraid of the police themselves. I’m asthmatic, and worry pepper spray or tear gas could end my life. I’m sure I’m not alone having difficulty weighing these decisions."
3,32,"You DON'T have to protest to make a difference! Talk with family and friends about the problems, write letters and call legislators, vote especially for local elections, sign petitions like the mail in voting one going around, donate to ACLU NAACP etc! There's so much work to be done and we can all play a part!"
4,21,"I would rather be at an outdoor protest in the sunshine, with a mask on, than in an indoor bar or restaurant without one"
5,6,I'm immunocompromised too and there are definitely  a  ton of ways to get involved.
6,9,If you have a black liver you are dead.
7,-15,"""Crush the police""... How thoughtless. When did activism against the BAD cops become ""crush the police""? Are you trying to get more innocent people assassinated?"
8,-4,[removed]
9,23,"As proud as I am, that's what I see here. Just a fuckin field day for Corona"
10,8,"2 weeks of mostly peaceful protests around the world vs years of racial injustice and systemic abuse

Ones been more out of control than the other

But same for both hopes. Witnessing major history in what's considered to be the largest civil rights movement ever right now"
11,7,"If it doesn't go out of control things won't change. Out of control is out of the regular, and the regular is exactly what we're trying to break free from."
12,8,Rasism and police brutality have cause far more damage and death than covid could ever hope to. I’d say the reason people are downvoting is because a lot of people opposing this movement (whatever their motivation be) are using covid as one of the many excuses as to why.
13,8,"I fear the pandemic as well, but this is too big and important to halt. The US curve has flattened some so it’s not the worst timing. Here in Brasil we are at peak and only keeps growing but cops keep going into people’s houses in the middle of a pandemic to shoot them, how can people stay inside only to wait to possibly die one way or another? I’m glad that BLM is making waves like these because they reverberate all over the globe."
14,2,"Being ""worried about your safety"" is how the karens and politicians frame it when they are trying to get people placated again. Time and time again. Covid is a huge concern here, but the time to be worried about safety was decades ago when we allowed racist laws to stay on the books post MLK. It was centuries ago when we allowed the south to keep it's racist heritage and not outlaw the confederate flag. It was back when all these corrupt police bureaus and unions were formed, and no one put any oversight in there or accountability. 

Do what you can to fight covid at the same time, but the bigger boss has entered the fight and we can't get bogged down slapping around the minions for the rest of our life any more. That tactic is what the power in the country has rolled out for decades with no reason to change the technique. That's why those comments get downvoted."
15,-1,There’s still less covid deaths than the flu. But everyone would happily protest during flu season
16,-1,"The virus was a bit overhyped anyway tbh, this is really the much more important issue right now."
17,1,"Come on, where the bot at :("
18,1,[video link](https://reddit.tube/d/ex8YLJF)
19,9,"...over the past 10 days. Have you not been paying attention? We're defunding them fam, and replacing the police (aka crush the police) with social organizations that focus on addressing the cause of crime (poverty). The current police structure was built on racism and oppression, it's too entrenched to ""change it."""
20,2,"As long as there are bad police, there are no good police."
21,8,I see more people wear a mask at protests than anywhere else. Plus open air and summer weather (probably) helps. It's still a risk though. This is too important to stop and I haven't seen evidence of medical being overwhelmed yet. Hopefully this doesn't cause a huge flair up of cases!
22,1,"Yea, something is being done... these protests. Protecting your health isn't really much of a concern when you might get gunned down by a ""boy in blue"" in the street, or a single bad, but treatable, sickness will bankrupt you for the rest of your life. More people have very little to lose in this country than anyone in the MSM or big political parties are comfortable talking about."
23,1,Thank you
24,1,So then how do I get a copy too?
