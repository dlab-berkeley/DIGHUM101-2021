I read one time where there was a maximum IQ, and if you were smarter than allowed, you didn't get in to cop school or whatever. They are actually picking meathead high school bully types to be cops. They give these guys a gun and immunity from most laws, and then act shocked when the power goes to their heads and they snap."

2,3,"Massive internment camps with the express purpose of re-educating and homogenizing and entire ethnic group out of unfounded fears of terrorism is genocide. And yes as you said, it isn't good. 

As far as your single article about tiananmen square, feel free to google other reputable sources to learn about what happened in china before during and after that terrible day. That article seems to be just fine with 300 dead protesters (still a massacre) since they were pro-capitalist demonstraters? But the truth is we will never know how many civilians died in china that day, and the totals are likely in the thousands. Who else killed them if it wasn't the CCP?"
3,1,Is this really the hill you want to die on? Making a competition of people's struggles? Cause that's what I hear from racist people all the time. This isn't the kind of crap I want to see in a BLM subreddit.

5,4,"Rather assign certain cops to certain areas so that they get to know the community personally and the community gets to know the cop aswell. They must be part of the community and the community must trust the cops or be replaced with cops they do trust. They must feel they can go to them whenever and the relationship must built over time. 

I doubt everyone has good intentions. Abolishing the cops will open the gates for people with bad intent to run free and who's going to stop them? The grass isnt greener on that side. 

Im not American but if cops were abolished in my country we'd be in hell. And I doubt people are very different over there.



Maybe just make training longer & better and weed out the psychopaths"

8,1,"Its for the missing, murdered Indigenous women. The movement has been around for a while but it never got recognized until most recently. Its celebrated on May 4tb and May 5th in Canada and the US. A lot of Indigenous communities are wanting Mexico to recognize it as well since most Tribes from the south west areas have ties to Mexico, as turtle Island was this land before colonizing and they were considering first nation people as well."
