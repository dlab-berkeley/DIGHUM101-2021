Puppies,Gary Dickinson,"Puppies: Puppy Book For Kids is a book about learning the fun way to love & care for your first dog.Puppies are so cute, cuddly and down right irresistible and Coco was no exception! From the moment we laid eyes on her, there was just that something about Coco that yelled out ""TAKE ME HOME; TAKE ME HOME!!"" In his book, the author shares the joy of owning and taking care of Coco his Toy Poodle. The photos in this book have been ""chosen by Coco"" and taken out of Coco's personal portfolio just as they are. No photoshopping, enhancing or manipulating in any shape or form. They will bring Coco alive and show her as authentic, cute and down right adorable!Puppies, no matter what kind of dog it is, always look cute and cuddly. They excite children... heck, they excite and melt all of our hearts when we see them. It's like they are born to love us right from day 1. Their joy and happiness are evident from the minute they ""arrive"" in the world.But, as the author also found out, owning a puppy is exhausting work. Even for a small little Toy Poodle!! Although fun, this book is intended to bring out some of the responsibilities of owning a puppy together with the joys and rewards. It's about Puppy Love: A children's book about learning the fun way to love & care for your first dog.Children are always attracted to dogs, and more specifically, to puppies. What's not to love and draw you to that cute little bundle of fur. It's like children can see that these animals are their perfect playmate. Puppies have something that shares their own energy level. The pictures in this book will show the playfulness and cuteness of a puppy while the text brings a certain amount of education about keeping and caring for a dog. Added to that, the author has also included some fun learning experiences for the children reading the book e.g. counting balls; recognizing objects in photos; participating in what they see.Just like children, dogs learn extremely quickly and that their behaviors have consequences. Dogs are particularly responsive to praise so it's important to constantly praise your dog when it does something well (or what you want). This will go a long way to teaching your dog obedience and control.Some of the responsibilities shared in the book are things like walking or exercising the dog including the responsibility of cleaning up after it, washing, brushing, grooming, health care e.g. vaccinations, feeding, keeping the water bowl full, training and the need for obedience. Children are helped to understand these concepts with the illustrations and related text.For parents of children ""begging"" to have a puppy, this book will serve to help prepare them for dog ownership. The book should encourage meaningful conversation about the merits of owning a dog along with the duties that need to be considered with that ownership. It will also help evaluate the readiness for that big step of ""Puppy Love"" and owning Your First Dog.",2014-09-16

Puppies require quite a bit of attention and love, as well as proper training when you are just starting out. Although they can be the most adorable creatures on the planet, they can also cause a considerable amount of problems. Depending upon the type of breed that you're working with, they may or may not be very easy to train. Regardless of how much work it will take, if you truly love animals, and want your puppy to grow up to be a healthy loyal friend and protector, there are a few tips and strategies you ought to know. In this article, we will present 10 facts about puppies that you ought to know. 1 - Puppies are born after a 63 day gestation cycle, which means the mom is only pregnant for 63 days. 2 - Puppies are born almost helpless, but they have several natural instincts the moment they are born. 3 - Puppies instinctually are able to nurse right after birth, and will spend a large portion of their time feeding and sleeping. 4 - The first couple weeks, puppies will be unable to open up their eyes. 5 - In the first few months of their life, they will grow very rapidly developing both physically and socially. 6 - Despite an independent nature, they learn quite a bit from their littermates soon after they are born. 7 - Puppies require quite a bit of socialization, meaning you will have to spend a great deal of time with them in order to familiarize them with their surroundings. 8 - Every puppy needs to be taken to the veterinarian within two months of their birth, not only for a check-up, but to get the initial shots that they will need. 9 - Puppies need to be dewormed at an early age, and they should also be checked for potentially deadly conditions such as Parvo. 10 - At some point, puppies will have to be potty trained, something that should start about two months after they are born. Although there are many more facts about puppies that you can learn, the best thing you can do is learn from experience, and also apply all of the techniques that you learn from books, the Internet, and people that have successfully trained puppies before. Having a puppy is a wonderful experience, but it takes hard work and dedication to allow them to become healthy adult dogs that you will love for many years to come.",2015-02-05
