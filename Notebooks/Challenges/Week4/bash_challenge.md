# Bash Challenge 1

Accomplish the following tasks using only Bash commands: 

1. Create a folder named "challenge" inside of your Week 4 directory

2. cd into this directory

3. Inside of the challenge directory, create a file named movies.txt

4. Add your favorite movie to this file

5. Copy this file to your Desktop

6. Delete the file from your challenge folder

7. Show the contents of movies.txt on your screen

8. Open movies.txt

> BONUS: what happens if you try to delete the challenge folder while there is still a file inside of it?

# Bash Challenge 2

1. Write a bash script named my_script.sh that accomplishes #1-10 from Challenge 1 but also that shows the current date and time (date) and calendar (cal) on the screen.

2. Open TextEdit (Mac) or WordPac (PC) to open a blank text file. Click Format --> "Make Plain Text"

3. Save this file as "my_script.sh" (without the quotations and with "Unicode UTF-8" format if possible)

4. Run the script using the bash command. If done correctly, you should see three things output: 1) your favorite movie name from the movies.txt file on your Desktop, 2) the current date and time, and 3) the calendar. 

> BONUS: If you run the file with the bash command from the solutions folder, why do you get the error message "The file ../../movies.txt does not exist"?
